					    An amusement park is a park that features various attractions, such as rides and games, as well as other events for entertainment purposes. 
					    A theme park is a type of amusement park that bases its structures and attractions around a central theme, often featuring multiple areas with different themes.
					    Unlike temporary and mobile funfairs and carnivals, amusement parks are stationary and built for long-lasting operation. They are more elaborate than city parks and playgrounds, usually providing attractions that cater to a variety of age groups.
					    While amusement parks often contain themed areas, theme parks place a heavier focus with more intricately-designed themes that revolve around a particular subject or group of subjects.

					    <p>Amusement parks evolved from European fairs, pleasure gardens and large picnic areas, which were created for people's recreation. 
					      World's fairs and other types of international expositions also influenced the emergence of the amusement park industry.
					      Lake Compounce opened in 1846 and is considered the oldest continuously-operating amusement park in North America.
					      The first theme parks emerged in the mid-twentieth century with the opening of Santa Claus Land in 1946, Santa's Workshop in 1949, and Disneyland in 1955.				         
                                            <br>   <br>   <p>   The amusement park evolved from three earlier traditions: traveling or periodic fairs, pleasure gardens and exhibitions such as world fairs. 
					    The oldest influence was the periodic fair of the Middle Ages - one of the earliest was the Bartholomew Fair in England from 1133.
					    By the 18th and 19th centuries, they had evolved into places of entertainment for the masses, where the public could view freak shows, acrobatics, conjuring and juggling, take part in competitions and walk through menageries.					        </p>
